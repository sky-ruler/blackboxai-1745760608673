# Netflix Clone

## Project Overview
The Netflix Clone is a simple web application that mimics the appearance and some functionalities of the Netflix streaming service. Developed using HTML and Tailwind CSS, this project serves as an illustrative prototype demonstrating responsive design and modern web development practices. Users can navigate through features, pricing, and a selection of trending shows while enjoying a sleek, dark-themed user interface.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser. You can explore the various sections including the hero section, pricing information, trending shows, and more. Interaction is mostly limited to form submissions, as this prototype does not connect to a backend.

## Features
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Hero section with a dynamic background image and a call-to-action form.
- Section displaying current trending shows.
- Detailed information about Netflix plans and features.
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section with expandable content.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com): For iconic fonts and symbols.

The project does not have a `package.json` as it doesn't utilize a JavaScript build system or framework.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
/netflix-clone
│
├── index.html              # Main HTML file containing the structure of the Netflix clone.
```

Each component of the page is built directly into the HTML file, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and classes for layout and design.
